# EasyDB
> A php system for store everything locally using JSON in a practical way.


## What for?
The system was based on the super simple way to save what you need without needing several lines that fill the screen.

## Resources
- ðŸ§  **Super** fast, no crashes.
- ðŸ“š **Organized** php code.
- ðŸŽŠ Save strings, images and objects **without losing definition**.
- ðŸ”§ **Practical** installation.

## How to use

### ðŸ”¨ Installation
- To get started, download the `easydb` file and place it in the folder where your php code is.
- After that, insert this into your php code:
```php
require 'easydb';
```
- The installation is already finished! time to learn to use.

The system is based on 2 things, tag and value.
For you to save an item, you need to define the tag, I will define as an example "fruit", now you will define the value, I will give the example as "banana".
```php
_store ("fruit", "banana");
```
it will return true, so you can use it in the if without additional text. now if i want to get this value i will define only the tag, which was fruit.
Would be like this:
```php
echo _get ("fruit");
```
it will return the value that I had set before: `banana`


I hope that you enjoyed. (âœ¿â— â€¿â— )
